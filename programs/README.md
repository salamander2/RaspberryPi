Raspberry Pi programs
=====================

All of my Raspberry Pi programs are here, each in their own folder, along with photos and schematic diagrams.

Enjoy.

The schematics are very easy to draw using the free ![Fritzing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salamander2/RaspberryPi/master/programs/fritzing-logo.png)  software. You can download a bunch of extra Adafruit stuff from https://github.com/adafruit/Fritzing-Library/blob/master/AdaFruit.fzbz

However, the breakout connector (aka Adafruit Cobbler) is labelled incorrectly. The names on the pins are not for the Raspberry Pi B revision 2 board. I have fixed this. You can download the corrected cobbler file for Fritzing from this folder (It's called [Adafruit Pi Cobbler.fzpz](https://github.com/salamander2/RaspberryPi/blob/master/programs/Adafruit%20Pi%20Cobbler.fzpz)) and in Fritzing, go to "File/Open" to import the correct breakout connector.  And ... this is what it looks like ...

### Android Apps

There are a few useful Android apps that work well with Raspberry Pi.

![JuiceSSH](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salamander2/RaspberryPi/master/programs/juiceSSH.png) **JuiceSSH** This is a good SSH program. You can connect to your RPi just as if you were using a computer.

![network](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salamander2/RaspberryPi/master/programs/network_scan.png) **Network Scan** This general purpose program will scan your local network and find all of the devices on it. It's good for finding your RPi's IP address if you don't know it.

![GPIO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salamander2/RaspberryPi/master/programs/GPIO_tool_RaspberryPi.png) **GPIO Tool Raspberry Pi** This is a very handy program for turning LEDs on and off. You can do a lot with the GPIO pins. Unfortunately, it does not have an option to shutdown or reboot the Raspberry Pi. Sometimes it gets stuck - you may need to clear all of it's data (clear app data).

![reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salamander2/RaspberryPi/master/programs/RPI_hardware_guide.png) **RPi Hardware Guide** This has a lot of information about the RPi. I don't know if you'll need it or not.
