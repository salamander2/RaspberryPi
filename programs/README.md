Raspberry Pi programs
=====================

All of my Raspberry Pi programs are here, each in their own folder, along with photos and schematic diagrams.

The Flasher program also has the separate Pulse program which uses PWM to make two LEDs pulse.

At the bottom of the *Flasher page* is instructions on how to make a program run automatically when the Raspberry Pi is powered on.

Enjoy.

### Android Apps

There are a few useful Android apps that work well with Raspberry Pi.

![JuiceSSH](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salamander2/RaspberryPi/master/programs/juiceSSH.png) **JuiceSSH** This is a good SSH program. You can connect to your RPi just as if you were using a computer.

![network](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salamander2/RaspberryPi/master/programs/fing.png) **Fing Network Scan** This general purpose program will scan your local network and find all of the devices on it. It's good for finding your RPi's IP address if you don't know it.

![GPIO](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salamander2/RaspberryPi/master/programs/GPIO_tool_RaspberryPi.png) **GPIO Tool Raspberry Pi** This is a very handy program for turning LEDs on and off. You can do a lot with the GPIO pins. Unfortunately, it does not have an option to shutdown or reboot the Raspberry Pi. Sometimes it gets stuck - you may need to clear all of its data (clear app data).

![reference](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salamander2/RaspberryPi/master/programs/RPI_hardware_guide.png) **RPi Hardware Guide** This has a lot of information about the RPi. I don't know if you'll need it or not. 

**RaspController Pro** -- I just installed this and it's awesome. I'll add more info soon.

The schematics are very easy to draw using the free ![Fritzing](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/salamander2/RaspberryPi/master/programs/fritzing-logo.png)  software. You can download a bunch of extra Adafruit stuff from https://github.com/adafruit/Fritzing-Library/blob/master/AdaFruit.fzbz
