Raspberry Pi programs
=====================

All of my Raspberry Pi programs are here, each in their own folder, along with photos and schematic diagrams.

Enjoy.

#### Fritzing
The schematics are very easy to draw using the free Fritzing software. You can download a bunch of extra Adafruit stuff from https://github.com/adafruit/Fritzing-Library/blob/master/AdaFruit.fzbz

However, the breakout connector (aka Adafruit Cobbler) is labelled incorrectly. The names on the pins are not for the Raspberry Pi B revision 2 board. I have fixed this. You can download the corrected cobbler file for Fritzing from this folder and in Fritzing, go to "File/Open" to import the correct breakout connector.
